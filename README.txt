This submission included "TrainingData_x.txt", "TrainingData_y", "TestingData_x.txt", and "TestingData_y.txt",
which contains the training & testing data in text files.

There are a IPYNB File and a Python File, named CSE353Assignment6_code. 
They both contain the same code. The code imported numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.pyplot libraries.

I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.

The CSE353_Assignment6_Report.pdf file is my report for this assignment.
